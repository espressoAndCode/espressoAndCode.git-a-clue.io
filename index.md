## Github for the Clueless

Have you ever worked late into the night on a class project, getting everything just *perfect* and then have your well-meaning team partner inexplicably delete all of your files? Did you want to choke them? I know I would.

Take a look at this video for one very sad story. It could happen.

### Github to the Rescue

Fortunately, there is a solution. Git and Github work together to help you keep track of your code files.

[Git](https://git-scm.com/ target="_blank") is a version control system, a tool to record incremental changes to your source code. You install Git on your computer and use it to manage your work locally.

[GitHub](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"} is an online platform for hosting Git repositories. You must create a free account on Github to use this service.

Git and Github work hand-in-hand to manage code under development and help teams collaborate easily and efficiently. When you first start using these tools, they can seem a bit overwhelming, so it's best to start with something small and build on that. The following video tutorial covers the process of duplicating or *forking* an existing Github repo, making changes to a file, and pushing the changes to your copy of the repo. This covers some of the most important basic commands that you will use *very* frequently as a software developer.

### Forking, Changing and Pushing

In order to follow along with this tutorial you will need to have Git installed on your computer, and have a Github account already set up. If you don't have those, you can follow along with the video and do the exercise later when you've set your system up.
